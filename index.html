          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            I successfully completed the Web Development Online Bootcamp at
            Imperial College London, in collaboration with HyperionDev. This
            intensive program provided a comprehensive education in modern web
            development, equipping me with a deep understanding of key
            technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.
            <br /><br />
            The bootcamp emphasized hands-on learning, allowing me to build
            complex, full-stack applications while honing my problem-solving and
            software development skills. This experience has strengthened my
            ability to work with the MERN stack, and has prepared me to tackle
            real-world challenges in the ever-evolving tech industry.

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>
            My skill set includes full-stack development, with proficiency in
            JavaScript, Node.js, and the MERN stack. I am well-versed in HTML,
            CSS, and Git, and I have experience working on diverse projects such
            as interactive web applications and API-driven solutions.
            <br /><br />
            Additionally, I have built and deployed a range of applications,
            including a feature-rich Discord bot and a dynamic web platform. My
            expertise extends to database management, server-side scripting, and
            UI development, allowing me to create scalable and efficient
            solutions.
            <br /><br />
            While I am continually improving my understanding of MongoDB,
            Express, and React, I am always eager to explore new technologies
            and methodologies to enhance my capabilities as a developer.
