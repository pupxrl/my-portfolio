        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I am a passionate web developer with 5+ years’ experience in
          JavaScript and Node.js with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, Git, and
          server-side programming. I am skilled in the MERN stack and a graduate
          of the Imperial College London bootcamp with HyperionDev.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am constantly exploring more efficient solutions, and I thrive on
          learning new technologies. My ultimate goal is to transition into AI
          development or game programming, using my problem-solving skills to
          build intelligent and immersive digital experiences.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
          With 5+ years of experience in JavaScript and Node.js, I have a strong
          grasp of web development, including HTML, CSS, Git, and server-side
          programming. <br /><br />
          I've worked on projects like a Discord bot/web app and improved my
          skills through the Imperial College London bootcamp with HyperionDev,
          where I learned more about the MERN stack.
          <br /><br />
          While I’m still improving my knowledge of MongoDB, Express, and React,
          I’m passionate about building websites and web applications and always
          working to grow my skills.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I successfully completed the Web Development Online Bootcamp at
          Imperial College London, in collaboration with HyperionDev. This
          intensive program provided a comprehensive education in modern web
          development, equipping me with a deep understanding of key
          technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js.
          <br /><br />
          The bootcamp emphasized hands-on learning, allowing me to build
          complex, full-stack applications while honing my problem-solving and
          software development skills. This experience has strengthened my
          ability to work with the MERN stack, and has prepared me to tackle
          real-world challenges in the ever-evolving tech industry.
